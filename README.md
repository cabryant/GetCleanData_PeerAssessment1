# GetCleanData_PeerAssessment1

The GetCleanData_PeerAssessment1 project produces a tidy dataset of merged test and training data from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" Data Set (see http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

The project consists of a single script that installs the necessary R libraries, downloads the source dataset to a data directory, and outputs a single tidy data.table to the data directory (tidy_summary.txt).  The script can be run out-of-the-box from any (internet accessible) location.  Details on the transform and the schema of the tidy summary are provided in CodeBook.md
